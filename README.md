# About
This is a repository for hosting my Emacs setup files (for now just .emacs)

# Credits
It is over time that I have gathered most of these hooks from the internet or work of 
other people and hooks in the file is not an original work. I have tried to provide 
credits wherever possible. If they are missing, please let me know, will be glad to 
add them.
